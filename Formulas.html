  <h3>Sum</h3>
  
  The sum formula is a formula which will automatically add up all values in a selected area. To use the formula, type "=sum()" and enter the desired area in between the brackets, in the formact of entering the first cell, colon, and entering the last cell. E.g. "=sum(A1:E5)". Then, the sum of the selected values should be shown. In this example, the cells in B2 to B10 is selected and a result is shown.

  The formulas automatically update when you update the values in the selected area(s). You can also select the area by dragging along the desired cells while holding down left click, and include multiple selections in the function by seperating them using a comma. E.g. "=sum(A1:A5,E4:E10)
