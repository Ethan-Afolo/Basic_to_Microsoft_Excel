  <h3>Cells</h3>
  
  The first thing you will see when you open an Excel document, are the cells. They are the rectangles on your document. Each rectangle is called a "cell". Each cell has a number and a letter in the alphabet. The larger the number, the further down the cell is, the higher the letter, the further right the cell is, vice versa.

  <br>
  <br>
  You can select a cell by clicking onto it, you can see which sell you are selecting by looking at the letter and number combination on the top left. After selecting a cell, you can insert a value into the selected cell. In this example, the cell at A1 was selected and the word "Apple" was being inserted.

  <br>
  <br>
  You can also move the cells by holding left click on the green border around the cell and releasing left click when the cell is at you desired location. In this example, the cell at A1 was moved to E5.
